This shapes the model’s “personality,” essentially creating a lossy simulation of a human labeler.\nPretraining All pages on the internet are filtered and combined into one massive text corpus.\nThis text is then tokenized into a sequence of finite symbols (tokens).\nNeural Network Training The model learns the statistical relationships between tokens—that is, how likely each token is to follow the ones before it in a sequence. During training, we fix a context window size (also called the context length). Within this window, the model looks at a sequence of tokens and predicts what comes next.\nInput: a variable‑length sequence of tokens (up to the context window size) Output: a probability distribution over the next possible token Inference When you talk to ChatGPT, the model is not learning anymore—it’s inferring:\nTake your text as input. Predict the next token. Append it to the context. Repeat step by step until a full response is generated. Base Model As shown in the figure below, the base model is simply a token autocompleter. Its output may vary because generation is stochastic. Post‑Training on Conversations (Mimicking an Expert Solution with SFT) After pretraining, the base model is further refined through Supervised Fine‑Tuning (SFT). In this phase, human labelers create high‑quality example conversations.\nThese conversations are fed back into the base model to teach it how to respond in a more helpful, structured, and human‑like way. What you receive from OpenAI is essentially a statistical simulation of those human labelers:\nIf your query is similar to examples in the training data, the response will closely match those patterns. If your query is unlike anything in the training data, the model relies on its broader, pretrained knowledge from the internet and prior conversations to generate a best‑effort answer. Hallucinations When the model lacks relevant knowledge, it may still respond with confident but incorrect information—this is known as a hallucination.\nHow can we reduce this?\nLeverage working memory (context).\nThis image explains the analogy — knowledge in parameters is like vague recollection, while knowledge in the current context window is like working memory. The knowledge stored in the model’s parameters is like a vague recollection from pretraining. In contrast, the information you include in the current context window—your prompt and any supplied data—acts as the model’s working memory. This context is directly accessible and far more reliable for generating accurate responses.\nModels need tokens to think Each token prediction in an LLM uses only a limited amount of computation. If you try to force the model to perform all reasoning in a single token, it may fail or produce errors. That’s why ChatGPT often works step by step—it spreads computation across multiple tokens and multiple passes through the network.\nBe mindful when asking ChatGPT to do arithmetic or counting.\n👉 Use code instead for exact calculations, because any intermediate step might be wrong if it exceeds the computation budget of a single pass.\nLLMs see text as tokens (text chunks). You can experiment with tokenization here.\nSpelling is another example where ChatGPT might fail.\nFor instance, try this prompt:\nPrint back the following string, but only print every 3rd character, starting with the first one. \"Ubiquitous\" don't use code. This does not work reliably (tested on ChatGPT on 2025‑07‑17).\nPost‑Training with Reinforcement Learning (Verifiable Domains) The image below illustrates an analogy between how ChatGPT learns and how a child learns. Reinforcement learning (RL) is used to further refine models. For example, AlphaGo used RL to discover new ways of playing Go. Could RL in LLMs create new ways of thinking? It’s an exciting possibility. In reinforcement learning (RL), we provide only the problem statement (the environment and rules) and the final outcomes (rewards or answers), but not the full step‑by‑step solution.\nThe model or agent learns by exploring different actions, observing the results, and gradually improving its strategy based on feedback, rather than being explicitly shown how to solve the problem. This image illustrates how, in post‑training with reinforcement learning, we provide a problem statement and an answer, let the model try many solutions, select the best, and repeat. RLHF (Non‑Verifiable Domains) In some tasks, it’s easy to verify the answer—like checking that 1 + 1 = 2.\nBut what if the task is subjective, such as writing a good joke? There’s no single “correct” answer. Scoring jokes directly with humans is very resource‑intensive.\nTo make this feasible, researchers create a reward model that tries to mimic human preferences:\nHumans are asked to rank or order multiple outputs (for example, several jokes). These rankings train a reward model that estimates what a “good” output looks like. The LLM then uses this reward model to guide its responses. Unlike standard reinforcement learning in verifiable domains, RLHF cannot run indefinitely because the model may eventually game the reward function, generating edge‑case outputs that score well but make little sense to humans.\nReference Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT ","wordCount":"869","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://yixiangyin.github.io/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2025-07-13T13:37:04+10:00","dateModified":"2025-07-13T13:37:04+10:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"yyx"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://yixiangyin.github.io/posts/llm/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Yin Yixiang","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://yixiangyin.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://yixiangyin.github.io/ accesskey=h title="About (Alt + H)"><img src=https://yixiangyin.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>About</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
